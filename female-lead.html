		<p><em>Prompt: If you were to hire a strong female lead, who would it be? What personality or physical characteristics motivate your choice?</em></p>
		<p>If I were to hire a strong female lead for a Hollywood movie, it would be <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378245/" target="_blank">Taraji P. Henson.</a> I'd hire Taraji because I was very impressed with her work as a strong female lead in <em>Hidden Figures.</em> Personality wise, I would want my female lead to be smart, assertive, and empowered, while also having the emotional intelligence to be conscientious and kind when interacting with others.</p>
		<p>When I think of a strong character, I think more in terms of the personality characteristics than the physical. I don't have any specific body types or other physical traits in mind. But because this is a Hollywood movie, I suppose the actress would need to be someone that is generally accepted as attractive by the public, which I'd say that Taraji P. Henson is.</p>
